# password-generator-automatic-copy-to-clipboard
It is a password generator to use together with your password manager in a faster and more efficient way. This will generate a password of a maximum of 24 characters in which there will be uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols and numbers generated completely random way. After generating the password, it will be automatically copied to the Windows clipboard and you will simply have to paste or do ctrl+v to paste your password. In my case I have the Windows clipboard history activated, I recommend that you activate it, but it shouldn't be necessary.
