# password-generator-automatic-copy-to-clipboard
It's a password generator to use together with your password manager in a faster and more efficient way. This will generate a password of a maximum of 24 characters in which there will be uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols and numbers generated in a completely random way. After generating the password, it will be automatically copied to the Windows clipboard and you will simply have to paste or do CTRL+V to paste your password. In my case I have the Windows clipboard history activated, I recommend that you activate it, but it shouldn't be necessary.
